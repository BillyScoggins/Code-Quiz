# Code-Quiz

# Purpose
As a programmer a potential employer could ask for me to create something similar to this.

My motivation for doing this project is to have a project to show potential employers.

I built this to show particular skills and understanding of coding languages.

My skills in HTML, JS, and CSS improved due to the challenge of the project.
